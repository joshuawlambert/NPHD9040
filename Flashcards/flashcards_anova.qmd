# Flashcards: ANOVA

## Understanding Hypothesis Testing

What is a null hypothesis?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
The null hypothesis (H₀) in hypothesis testing states that there is no significant difference or relationship between variables.

## Constructing Hypotheses

What is the purpose of formulating both written and mathematical hypotheses?

:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Formulating both written and mathematical hypotheses ensures clarity and precision in stating the research question and allows for statistical testing.

## Type 1 Error

What is Type 1 Error?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Type 1 Error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, indicating a significant result when there is no true effect or relationship (false positive).
:::
:::

## Type 2 Error

What is Type 2 Error?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Type 2 Error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly retained, failing to detect a true effect or relationship (false negative).
:::
:::

## Assumptions of ANOVA

What are the assumptions of ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Assumptions of ANOVA include: normal distribution of the dependent variable, homogeneity of variance, independence of observations, and categorical independent variables.
:::
:::

## Visualizing Data Distribution

How do boxplots help in visualizing data distribution?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Boxplots provide a graphical representation of the distribution of data, showing the median, quartiles, and outliers across different groups or categories.
:::
:::

## Calculating Degrees of Freedom

How are degrees of freedom calculated in ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Degrees of freedom in ANOVA are calculated as the number of independent observations minus the number of parameters estimated from the sample.
:::
:::

## Understanding the F Statistic

What does the F statistic represent in ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
The F statistic in ANOVA measures the ratio of variance between groups to variance within groups, indicating whether there are significant differences among group means.
:::
:::

## Post-hoc Analysis

What is the purpose of post-hoc analysis in ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Post-hoc analysis in ANOVA is performed after finding a significant F-statistic to identify which specific groups differ from each other.
:::
:::

## Homogeneity of Variance

Why is homogeneity of variance important in ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Homogeneity of variance ensures that the variability within each group is approximately equal across all groups, which is an assumption for valid ANOVA results.
:::
:::

## The F Distribution

How is the p-value calculated from the F distribution?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
The p-value in ANOVA is calculated based on the F statistic and the degrees of freedom, representing the probability of obtaining the observed results under the null hypothesis.
:::
:::

## Sum of Squares

What are Sum of Squares Between (SSB) and Sum of Squares Within (SSW) in ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
SSB represents the variation between groups' means, while SSW represents the variation within each group.
:::
:::

## ANOVA Hypotheses

What are the null and alternative hypotheses in ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
The null hypothesis (H₀) states that all group means are equal, while the alternative hypothesis (H₁) states that at least one group mean is different.
:::
:::

## ANOVA Assumptions

What assumptions should be checked before performing ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Before performing ANOVA, it is essential to check assumptions such as normality of residuals, homogeneity of variance, independence of observations, and linearity of relationships.
:::
:::

## Comparing ANOVA and t-tests

What is the difference between ANOVA and t-tests?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
While t-tests are used to compare means between two groups, ANOVA is used to compare means across multiple groups simultaneously.
:::
:::

## Understanding Degrees of Freedom

Why are degrees of freedom important in statistical analysis?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Degrees of freedom represent the number of independent pieces of information available for estimating statistical parameters, influencing the precision and reliability of statistical tests.
:::
:::

## Visualizing ANOVA Results

How can ANOVA results be visually represented?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
ANOVA results can be visually represented using bar charts, boxplots, or interaction plots to illustrate group differences and statistical significance.
:::
:::

## Understanding Post-hoc Tests

When should post-hoc tests be conducted in ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Post-hoc tests should be conducted after obtaining a significant ANOVA result to determine which specific group differences contribute to the overall significance.
:::
:::

## Statistical Power in ANOVA

What is statistical power in ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Statistical power in ANOVA represents the probability of detecting a true effect or relationship when it exists, minimizing the risk of Type 2 Error.
