### What is the purpose of Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Two-Way ANOVA evaluates the effects of two independent variables on a continuous dependent variable, including their interaction.
:::
:::

### What is a main effect in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
A main effect is the impact of one independent variable on the dependent variable, ignoring the levels of the other independent variable.
:::
:::

### What is an interaction effect in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
An interaction effect occurs when the combined effect of two independent variables on the dependent variable is different from the sum of their individual effects.
:::
:::

### How many main effects and interaction effects can be analyzed in a Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Two-Way ANOVA can analyze two main effects (one for each factor) and one interaction effect between them.
:::
:::

### What is the null hypothesis for the main effect of Factor A in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
The null hypothesis ((H_0)) for the main effect of Factor A states that all levels of Factor A have the same mean.
:::
:::

### What is the alternative hypothesis for the main effect of Factor B in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
The alternative hypothesis ((H_1)) for the main effect of Factor B states that at least one level of Factor B has a different mean.
:::
:::

### What is the null hypothesis for the interaction effect in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
The null hypothesis ((H_0)) for the interaction effect states that there is no interaction between Factors A and B.
:::
:::

### What are the assumptions of Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question

:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
```         
<ul>
  <li>Normality of residuals</li>
  <li>Homogeneity of variances</li>
  <li>Continuous dependent variable</li>
  <li>Categorical independent variables</li>
  <li>Random sampling</li>
</ul>
```

### What is the Sum of Squares for Factor A (SSA)?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
$$
SSA = \sum_{j=1}^{a} n_{j} (\bar{Y}_{j\cdot} - \bar{Y})^2
$$
:::
:::

### How do you calculate the Mean Square for Factor B (MSB)?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
$$
MSB = \frac{SSB}{b - 1}
$$
:::
:::

### What is the formula for the F-Ratio of the main effect for Factor A?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
$$
F_A = \frac{MSA}{MSE}
$$
:::
:::

### What does a significant interaction effect imply in a Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
A significant interaction effect indicates that the impact of one factor on the dependent variable differs depending on the levels of the other factor.
:::
:::

### What is eta squared (( \eta\^2 )) in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Eta squared (( \eta\^2 )) is a measure of the proportion of the total variance explained by a factor or interaction effect.
:::
:::

### What post-hoc test is commonly used in Two-Way ANOVA to compare specific group means?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test.
:::
:::

### How do you interpret a significant main effect in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
A significant main effect indicates that the means of different levels of one factor are not equal.
:::
:::

### What graphical method can help identify the presence of interaction effects in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Interaction plots can help identify the presence of interaction effects by plotting the means of different groups.
:::
:::

### What does the F-statistic represent in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
The F-statistic represents the ratio of the variance between groups to the variance within groups.
:::
:::

### What are the degrees of freedom for the interaction effect in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
$$
df_{AB} = (a - 1)(b - 1)
$$
:::
:::

### What is the purpose of a residual plot in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
A residual plot helps check for homoscedasticity and outliers by plotting the residuals against fitted values.
:::
:::

### Why is it important to check for influential observations in Two-Way ANOVA?

::: {.flashcard onclick="revealAnswer(this)"}
::: question
Click to reveal answer
:::

::: {.answer style="display: none;"}
Influential observations can unduly affect the results of Two-Way ANOVA, leading to biased or incorrect conclusions.
