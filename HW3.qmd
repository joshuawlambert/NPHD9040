## 1. Use the "coffee.jmp" file to complete a 2-Way ANOVA. The dependent variable will be the strength of the coffee, independent variable 1 is the Grind of the coffee, and independent variable 2 is the time the coffee is brewed. Here are the descriptions of the variables:

-   **Grind**: Coarseness of the ground beans
-   **Temperature**: Temperature of the water used to brew the coffee (in degrees Fahrenheit)
-   **Time**: Brewing time in minutes
-   **Charge**: Grams of coffee beans per ounce of water
-   **Station**: Table at which the coffee was brewed
-   **Strength**: Number of dissolved solids in the coffee as measured by a refractometer

### a. Please first plot the relationship using a method we discussed.

### b. Conduct the two-way ANOVA. What is the conclusion about the interaction between the two independent variables?

\`\`\` \[Your ANOVA results and conclusion here\] \`\`\`

### c. If the interaction was significant, complete a Tukey's post-hoc test, if not, complete a Tukey's post-hoc test on the lower order terms that were significant (p-value\<0.05).

\`\`\` \[Your post-hoc test results here\] \`\`\`

### d. Report the conclusion in words that are understandable to a lay person, as well as to someone who is in 9040, and me! Let me know if you have any questions.

### 4. In a 2-way ANOVA, what does an interaction effect indicate?

-   [ ] A. The effect of each independent variable is additive.
-   [ ] B. The effect of one independent variable depends on the level of the other variable.
-   [ ] C. Both independent variables have no effect on the dependent variable.

### 5. What is a potential disadvantage of using repeated measures in an ANOVA?

-   [ ] A. Increased risk of Type II errors.
-   [ ] B. Decreased statistical power.
-   [ ] C. Carryover effects.
-   [ ] D. Increased risk of violating the assumption of independence.

\`\`\` \[Your answer here\] \`\`\`

### 6. In the context of 2-way ANOVA, what does the term 'main effect' refer to?

-   [ ] A. The combined effect of the two independent variables.
-   [ ] B. The effect of each independent variable considered separately.
-   [ ] C. The effect that is common to both independent variables.
-   [ ] D. The effect that is not accounted for by the independent variables.

\`\`\` \[Your answer here\] \`\`\`

### 7. Which of the following is a correct interpretation of a significant interaction in a 2-way ANOVA?

-   [ ] A. The independent variables independently influence the dependent variable.
-   [ ] B. The effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable changes across levels of the other variable.
-   [ ] C. The dependent variable is not affected by either of the independent variables.
-   [ ] D. The interaction is an artifact of measurement error.
