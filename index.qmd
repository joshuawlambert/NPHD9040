## Overview of NPHD9040

NPHD9040 is designed to provide an in-depth exploration of advanced statistical methods relevant to healthcare research. **The course uses R statistical software** for all analyses, emphasizing practical applications and reproducible research. Topics include:

## Getting Started with R

**New to R?** Start here! We've created a comprehensive guide to help you get up and running with R and RStudio:

### [📘 Getting Started with R](Lectures/getting-started-with-r.qmd)

This module covers everything you need to know:
- Installing R and RStudio
- Navigating the RStudio interface  
- R fundamentals (objects, data types, functions)
- Importing and manipulating data
- Using R packages
- Getting help and troubleshooting

### Download R and RStudio

1. **Download R**: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. **Download RStudio**: [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

> **💡 Tip**: Install R first, then RStudio. Both are completely free!
