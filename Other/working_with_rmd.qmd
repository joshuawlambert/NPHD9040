# What is R Markdown?

R Markdown (`.Rmd`) is a file format that allows you to save and execute R code within a document. It combines your code, the output of that code (graphs, tables, values), and your written commentary into a single nice-looking report (HTML, PDF, or Word).

# The Anatomy of an R Markdown File

An RMD file has three main parts:

## 1. The YAML Header

This is the block of text at the very top of the file, enclosed by three dashes (`---`). It controls the document's settings.

```yaml
---
title: "Homework 1"
author: "Your Name"
date: "2024-01-01"
output: html_document
---
```

**What you do:** Change the `author` and `date` to your own.

## 2. Text (Markdown)

You can type normal text anywhere in the document (outside of the code chunks). You can use Markdown syntax to format your text:

*   **Bold**: `**text**` -> **text**
*   *Italic*: `*text*` -> *text*
*   Headers: `#` for main titles, `##` for section titles.

## 3. Code Chunks

This is where your R code lives. A code chunk looks like this:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
# This is a comment inside code
mean(c(1, 2, 3))
```
````

*   **Insert a Chunk**: You can type it manually or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + I` (Windows) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac).
*   **Run a Chunk**: Click the green "Play" button at the top right of the chunk to run the code and see the output immediately below it.

# How to Complete Your Assignments

1.  **Download the Template**: Use the link provided in the assignment page.
2.  **Open in RStudio**: Do not just double-click; ensure it opens in RStudio.
3.  **Edit**:
    *   Update the YAML top section with your name.
    *   Scroll down to the questions.
    *   Type your specific code into the empty code chunks provided (e.g., `# Your code here`).
    *   Type your written answers in the white space outside the chunks.
4.  **Knit**: When you are finished, click the **Knit** button at the top of the editor window. This will execute all your code from scratch and create an HTML file.
5.  **Submit**: Upload both the `.Rmd` file and the resulting `.html` file to Canvas.

# Troubleshooting

*   **Code error?** If your code has an error, the document will likely fail to Knit. Check the "Render" tab or run your chunks manually to find the mistake.
*   **Missing package?** If you see "there is no package called...", run `install.packages("package_name")` in your **Console** (bottom left), not in the RMD file itself.
