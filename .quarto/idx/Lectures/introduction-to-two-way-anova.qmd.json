It is an\nextension of One-Way ANOVA but allows for the simultaneous evaluation of\ntwo factors, making it suitable for analyzing more complex experimental\ndesigns.\n\n### Key Differences Between One-Way and Two-Way ANOVA\n\n-   **One-Way ANOVA:** Evaluates the effect of a single independent\n    variable on a continuous outcome.\n-   **Two-Way ANOVA:** Evaluates the effects of two independent\n    variables (factors), including any interaction between them.\n\n## Understanding the Structure of a Two-Way ANOVA Design\n\nIn a Two-Way ANOVA, each factor (independent variable) can have multiple\nlevels. For example, in a clinical trial examining the effects of drug\ndosage (Factor 1) and diet (Factor 2), the design might include: -\n**Factor 1 (Dosage):** Low, Medium, High - **Factor 2 (Diet):** Control,\nLow-Fat, High-Fat\n\n### Main Effects and Interaction\n\n-   **Main Effect:** The impact of one factor on the dependent variable,\n    ignoring the levels of the other factor.\n-   **Interaction Effect:** The combined effect of both factors on the\n    dependent variable that is different from the sum of their\n    individual effects.\n\n## Assumptions of Two-Way ANOVA\n\n### Normality of Residuals\n\nResiduals (errors) should be normally distributed.\n\n### Homogeneity of Variances\n\nVariances should be approximately equal across all levels of the\nfactors.\n\n## Calculation of SS (Sum of Squares) and MS (Mean Squares)\n\n### Sum of Squares\n\n-   **Total Sum of Squares (SST):** $$\n    SST = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i -
