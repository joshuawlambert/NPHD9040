It is interpreted as the odds of the outcome occurring given\nthe presence of a particular predictor.\n\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\exp(\\beta_i) $$\n\n-   **OR \\> 1:** Positive association between predictor and outcome.\n-   **OR \\< 1:** Negative association between predictor and outcome.\n-   **OR = 1:** No association.\n\n## Formulating the Logistic Regression Equation; Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\n\n1.  **Model Specification:**\n    $$ \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_kX_k $$\n\n2.  **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** The logistic regression\n    coefficients are estimated by maximizing the likelihood function:\n    $$ L(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{1 - y_i} $$ where\n    ( p_i ) is the predicted probability for the ( i )-th observation.\n\n## Estimating the Regression Coefficients\n\nThe coefficients are estimated using MLE. Most statistical software\nprovides direct estimation.\n\n## Testing the Significance of the Regression Coefficients\n\n-   **Wald Test:** Tests individual coefficients.\n-   **Likelihood Ratio Test:** Compares nested models.\n-   **Score Test:** Similar to the likelihood ratio test.\n\n## Confidence Intervals for the Coefficients\n\nConfidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for the\ncoefficients.\n\n$$ CI = \\hat{\\beta_i} \\pm z^* \\cdot SE(\\hat{\\beta_i}) $$\n\n## Deviance and Goodness-of-Fit Tests\n\n-   **Deviance:** Measure of model fit, similar to residual sum of\n    squares.\n-   **Likelihood Ratio Test (Chi-Square):** Compares the deviance of\n    nested models.\n-   **Hosmer-Lemeshow Test:** Assesses model calibration.\n\n## Interpretation of Regression Coefficients; Understanding the Impact of Predictors on Odds\n\n### Example\n\nAssume a logistic regression model predicting diabetes (yes/no) based on\nage and BMI:\n\n$$ \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = -5 + 0.05 \\cdot \\text{Age} + 0.2 \\cdot \\text{BMI} $$\n\nInterpretation: - **Intercept (-5):** Baseline log-odds of diabetes for\na patient with Age = 0 and BMI = 0. - **Age Coefficient (0.05):** For\neach one-year increase in age, the odds of diabetes increase by (\ne\\^{0.05} \\approx 1.05 ) times. - **BMI Coefficient (0.2):** For each\nunit increase in BMI, the odds of diabetes increase by ( e\\^{0.2}\n\\approx 1.22 ) times.\n\n## Stepwise Logistic Regression\n\nStepwise logistic regression involves automatic selection of predictors\nbased on criteria like AIC, BIC, or p-values.\n\n-   **Forward Selection:** Starts with no variables and adds one at a\n    time.\n-   **Backward Elimination:** Starts with all variables and removes one\n    at a time.\n-   **Bidirectional Elimination:** Combines forward and backward\n    methods.\n\n## Interpreting Odds Ratios for Categorical and Continuous Predictors\n\n-   **Categorical Predictors:** Interpret the OR relative to the\n    reference category.\n-   **Continuous Predictors:** Interpret the OR per unit increase in the\n    predictor.\n\n## Checking Assumptions of Logistic Regression\n\n1.  **Linearity in Logit:** Ensure continuous predictors are linearly\n    related to the logit.\n2.  **Absence of Multicollinearity:** Check variance inflation factors\n    (VIF).\n3.  **No Outliers/Influential Observations:** Use Cook's distance or\n    leverage plots.\n\n## Examples of Logistic Regression in Nursing Research\n\n### Example 1: Predicting Diabetes\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n# Logistic Regression in R\n        data <- read.csv(\"health_data.csv\")\n        model <- glm(Diabetes ~ Age + BMI, data = data, family = \"binomial\")\n        summary(model)\n```\n\n### Example 2: Predicting Heart Disease\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n# Logistic Regression in R\n        data <- read.csv(\"heart_data.csv\")\n        model <- glm(HeartDisease ~ Age + Cholesterol + Smoking, data = data, family = \"binomial\")\n        summary(model)\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLogistic regression is a crucial tool in healthcare research, providing\ninsights into the relationship between various factors and patient\noutcomes.
