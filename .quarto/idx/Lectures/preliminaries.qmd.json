Use `factor()` to convert character variables to factors, especially for ordinal data where you can specify the order.\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n# Convert to factor\npain_level <- factor(c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\", \"low\", \"high\"))\n\n# Ordered factor (for ordinal data)\npain_level <- factor(c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\", \"low\", \"high\"),\n                     levels = c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"),\n                     ordered = TRUE)\n```\n\n### Understand the P-Value: Pros and Cons\n\n-   The p-value is a statistical measure that helps assess evidence against the null hypothesis.\n-   **Pros:**\n    -   Easy to interpret.\n    -   Helps determine statistical significance.\n-   **Cons:**\n    -   Often misinterpreted (e.g., \"significant\" does not always imply clinical relevance).\n    -   Can be misleading in the presence of small sample sizes.\n    -   Does not measure effect size or practical importance.\n\n> **💡 R Tip**: In R, p-values are typically found in the output of statistical tests. Look for columns labeled `Pr(>|t|)`, `p-value`, or similar. A common threshold is p < 0.05 for statistical significance.\n\n### Determine Sample Size and Power\n\n-   **Sample Size:** Ensure that the proposed sample is large enough to answer your research question confidently.\n-   **Power Analysis:** Conduct a power analysis to determine the minimum sample size required.\n    -   **Power:** Probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis (typically 0.80 or 80%).\n    -   **Type I Error (α):** Probability of a false positive (usually 0.05).\n    -   **Type II Error (β):** Probability of a false negative (usually 0.20).\n-   **Factors Influencing Power:**\n    -   Effect size\n    -   Significance level\n    -   Sample size\n\n#### Power Analysis in R\n\nR has the `pwr` package for power calculations:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n# Install the package (only once)\ninstall.packages(\"pwr\")\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(pwr)\n\n# Example: Power analysis for t-test\n# What sample size do we need to detect a medium effect (d=0.5)\n# with 80% power at alpha=0.05?\npwr.t.test(d = 0.5,           # Effect size (Cohen's d)\n           sig.level = 0.05,   # Alpha\n           power = 0.80,       # Desired power\n           type = \"two.sample\")\n\n# Example: What power do we have with n=30 per group?\npwr.t.test(n = 30,\n           d = 0.5,\n           sig.level = 0.05,\n           type = \"two.sample\")\n```\n\n> **💡 R Tip**: Common effect sizes (Cohen's d): small = 0.2, medium = 0.5, large = 0.8. The `pwr` package has functions for many test types: `pwr.t.test()`, `pwr.anova.test()`, `pwr.chisq.test()`, etc.\n\n### Working with Data in R\n\n#### Setting Up Your Workspace\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n# Check your current working directory\ngetwd()\n\n# Set working directory to where your data is stored\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/NPHD9040\")\n\n# Or use RStudio: Session → Set Working Directory → Choose Directory\n```\n\n> **💡 R Tip**: Keep all files for a project in one folder. This makes it easier to manage your data, scripts, and output.\n\n#### Reading Data into R\n\nFor a more detailed guide on importing different file types (including using the RStudio GUI), see the [Getting Started with R](getting-started-with-r.qmd#reading-data-from-csv-files) module.\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n# Read CSV file\nmy_data <- read.csv(\"patient_data.csv\")\n\n# Select file interactively\n# my_data <- read.csv(file.choose())\n\n# Read CSV with specific options\nmy_data <- read.csv(\"patient_data.csv\",\n                    header = TRUE,        # First row contains column names\n                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)  # Don't auto-convert to factors\n\n# For Excel files, use readxl package\nlibrary(readxl)\nmy_data <- read_excel(\"patient_data.xlsx\")\n\n# View the data\nView(my_data)  # Opens in spreadsheet viewer\nhead(my_data)  # First 6 rows\ntail(my_data)  # Last 6 rows\n```\n\n### Taking Your Data on a Date: Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n-   **Collect Consistent and High-Quality Data:**\n    -   Use secure electronic records whenever possible (e.g., REDCap).\n    -   Consult the Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning data collection.\n    -   Take note of possible biases or skewed observations that may affect results.\n-   **Transform and Organize Data:**\n    -   **Raw Data:** Direct data collected from your research.\n    -   **Tidy Data:** Organized and transformed version of raw data.\n    -   Apply necessary transformations (e.g., standardization) to clean your data.\n-   **Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis:**\n    -   Summarize your data using basic descriptive statistics.\n    -   Visualize your data through various graphs (e.g., histograms, box plots).\n    -   Identify potential differences and insights within or between groups.\n\n#### Descriptive Statistics in R\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n# Summary statistics for all variables\nsummary(my_data)\n\n# Mean, median, standard deviation for a specific variable\nmean(my_data$age)\nmedian(my_data$age)\nsd(my_data$age)\n\n# Remove missing values with na.rm = TRUE\nmean(my_data$age, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Frequency table for categorical variables\ntable(my_data$treatment_group)\n\n# Cross-tabulation\ntable(my_data$treatment_group, my_data$outcome_category)\n\n# Proportions\nprop.table(table(my_data$treatment_group))\n```\n\n> **💡 R Tip**: Use `str(my_data)` to see the structure of your data frame. This shows variable names, types, and first few values - very helpful for understanding your data!\n\n#### Checking for Missing Data\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n# Check for missing values\nsum(is.na(my_data))  # Total missing values\n\n# Missing values per variable\ncolSums(is.na(my_data))\n\n# Identify rows with any missing values\nmy_data[!complete.cases(my_data), ]\n\n# Remove rows with missing values (use with caution!)\nmy_data_complete <- na.omit(my_data)\n```\n\n## Comprehensive Example: Complete Exploratory Analysis\n\nLet's walk through a complete exploratory data analysis workflow in R:\n\n```{r}\n# ============================================\n# Exploratory Data Analysis Example\n# Research Question: Do pain scores differ by treatment group?\n# ============================================\n\n# Step 1: Create sample data (normally you'd read from a file)\nset.seed(123)  # For reproducibility\npain_study <- data.frame(\n  patient_id = 1:60,\n  age = round(rnorm(60, mean = 55, sd = 12)),\n  sex = sample(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), 60, replace = TRUE),\n  treatment = rep(c(\"Standard\", \"Intervention A\", \"Intervention B\"), each = 20),\n  baseline_pain = round(rnorm(60, mean = 7, sd = 1.5), 1),\n  followup_pain = c(\n    round(rnorm(20, mean = 6.5, sd = 1.5), 1),  # Standard\n    round(rnorm(20, mean = 4.5, sd = 1.5), 1),  # Intervention A\n    round(rnorm(20, mean = 3.8, sd = 1.5), 1)   # Intervention B\n  )\n)\n\n# Step 2: Examine the data structure\ncat(\"Data Structure:\\n\")\nstr(pain_study)\n\ncat(\"\\n\\nFirst few rows:\\n\")\nhead(pain_study)\n\n# Step 3: Check for missing data\ncat(\"\\n\\nMissing values per variable:\\n\")\ncolSums(is.na(pain_study))\n\n# Step 4: Convert categorical variables to factors\npain_study$sex <- factor(pain_study$sex)\npain_study$treatment <- factor(pain_study$treatment)\n\n# Step 5: Descriptive statistics -

Use comments (#) liberally to explain what each section does!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFollowing these preliminary steps will ensure a solid foundation for statistical analysis. Carefully consider each step, from hypothesis formulation to data collection and exploration. Being thorough in the preliminaries will enhance the validity and reliability of your findings.\n\n**Remember**: R makes your analysis reproducible. Every step is documented in code, which means you (or others) can verify and replicate your work!\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":"html","warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"columns":12,"css":["../styles.css"],"output-file":"preliminaries.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
