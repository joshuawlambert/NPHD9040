It is an extension of [One-Way\nANOVA](introduction-to-anova.qmd) but accounts for the correlation between repeated measures on the\nsame subjects.\n\n### Key Differences Between Repeated Measures ANOVA and One-Way ANOVA\n\n-   **One-Way ANOVA:** Evaluates the effect of a single independent\n    variable on a continuous outcome.\n-   **Repeated Measures ANOVA:** Evaluates the effect of a single or\n    multiple within-subject factors over time, accounting for the\n    correlation between repeated measurements.\n\n## Understanding the Structure of a Repeated Measures Design\n\nIn a Repeated Measures design, each participant is measured multiple\ntimes under different conditions or over time. The design includes: -\n**Within-Subjects Factors:** Variables measured repeatedly on the same\nsubjects. - **Levels:** The different conditions or time points for each\nwithin-subjects factor.\n\n### Example Structure\n\n-   **Within-Subjects Factor:** Time\n-   **Levels:** Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3\n\n## Sphericity Assumption\n\nSphericity refers to the assumption that the variances of the\ndifferences between all combinations of related groups are equal. If\nviolated, it can lead to biased F-statistics and increased Type I\nerrors.\n\n### Greenhouse-Geisser Correction\n\nThe Greenhouse-Geisser correction adjusts the degrees of freedom to\ncorrect for violations of sphericity, providing a more conservative\nestimate.\n\n## Calculation of SS (Sum of Squares) and MS (Mean Squares)\n\n### Sum of Squares\n\n-   **Total Sum of Squares (SST):** $$\n    SST = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{t} (Y_{ij} - \\bar{Y})^2\n    $$ where ( Y\\_{ij} ) is each individual observation, and ( \\bar{Y} )\n    is the overall mean.\n\n-   **Sum of Squares Within (SSW):** $$\n    SSW = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{t} (Y_{ij} - \\bar{Y}_{i\\cdot})^2\n    $$ where ( \\bar{Y}\\_{i\\cdot} ) is the mean of all measurements for\n    subject ( i ).\n\n-   **Sum of Squares Between (SSB):** $$\n    SSB = \\sum_{j=1}^{t} n_j (\\bar{Y}_{\\cdot j} - \\bar{Y})^2\n    $$ where ( \\bar{Y}\\_{\\cdot j} ) is the mean for level ( j ), and (\n    n_j ) is the number of observations at level ( j ).\n\n### Mean Squares\n\n-   **Mean Square Within (MSW):** $$\n    MSW = \\frac{SSW}{(n - 1)(t - 1)}\n    $$\n\n-   **Mean Square Between (MSB):** $$\n    MSB = \\frac{SSB}{t - 1}\n    $$\n\n## Hypothesis Testing for Main Effects and Interaction\n\n### Hypotheses\n\n-   **Main Effect of Within-Subjects Factor:**\n    -   Null Hypothesis (( H_0 )): No difference in the means across\n        levels.\n    -   Alternative Hypothesis (( H_1 )): At least one level has a\n        different mean.\n-   **Interaction Effect:**\n    -   Null Hypothesis (( H_0 )): No interaction between\n        within-subjects factors.\n    -   Alternative Hypothesis (( H_1 )): An interaction exists between\n        factors.\n\n### F-Ratio Calculations\n\n-   **Main Effect of Within-Subjects Factor:** $$\n    F = \\frac{MSB}{MSW}\n    $$\n\n### Interpretation\n\n-   Compare the F-ratio to the critical value from the F-distribution.\n-   If the calculated F-ratio is greater than the critical value, reject\n    the null hypothesis.\n\n## Effect Sizes and Significance\n\n### Eta Squared (( \\eta\\^2 ))\n\nRepresents the proportion of the total variance explained by the\nwithin-subjects factor.\n\n-   **Within-Subjects Factor:** $$\n    \\eta^2 = \\frac{SSB}{SST}\n    $$\n\n## Bonferroni Correction\n\nA post-hoc correction used to reduce Type I errors when multiple\ncomparisons are made. When conducting multiple tests, the risk of a false positive (Type I error) increases significantly.
