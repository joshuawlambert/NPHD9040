It is used to predict the\noutcome variable based on the values of the independent variables and to\nunderstand the impact of each predictor on the outcome.\n\n### Key Concepts and Assumptions\n\n1.  **Linearity:** The relationship between the predictors and the\n    outcome is linear.\n2.  **Independence:** Observations are independent of each other.\n3.  **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of residuals (errors) is constant\n    across all levels of the independent variables.\n4.  **No multicollinearity:** Independent variables are not too highly\n    correlated.\n5.  **Normality:** Residuals should be normally distributed.\n\n## Formulating the Regression Equation\n\nThe multiple linear regression equation is expressed as: $$\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_nx_n + \\epsilon\n$$ where: - ( y ): Dependent variable - ( \\beta\\_0 ): Y-intercept - (\n\\beta\\_1, \\beta\\_2, \\dots, \\beta\\_n ): Coefficients of predictors ( x_1,\nx_2, \\dots, x_n ) - ( \\epsilon ): Random error\n\n## Estimating the Regression Coefficients\n\nRegression coefficients are estimated using the method of least squares,\nwhich minimizes the sum of the squared differences between observed and\npredicted values.\n\n### Formula\n\n-   **Coefficient ((** \\beta )): $$\n    \\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\n    $$\n\n## Testing the Significance of the Regression Coefficients\n\nStatistical tests (typically t-tests) are used to determine whether each\ncoefficient significantly differs from zero, indicating a significant\nrelationship between the predictor and the outcome.\n\n### Formula\n\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{SE(\\hat{\\beta})}\n$$\n\n## Confidence Intervals for the Coefficients\n\nConfidence intervals provide a range of values which are likely to\ncontain the population coefficients.\n\n### Formula\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} \\pm t^* \\cdot SE(\\hat{\\beta})\n$$\n\n## Coefficient of Determination (R-squared)\n\nR-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent\nvariable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n\n### Formula\n\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{\\sum (\\hat{y} -
