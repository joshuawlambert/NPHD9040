Please email [joshua.lambert@uc.edu](mailto:joshua.lambert@uc.edu) with more questions.\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.faq}\n\n1. ### What’s the best statistical test to compare CRNA autonomy levels (supervised vs collaborative) between different types of counties (urban vs rural)?\n   ::: {.faq-answer}\n   The **Chi-square test** is appropriate since you're comparing two categorical variables: autonomy level (supervised vs. collaborative) and county type (urban vs. rural).\n   :::\n\n2. ### Is it okay to use only descriptive stats for current state data, or do I need inferential tests too?\n   ::: {.faq-answer}\n   For QI projects that just describe the current state (no group comparisons/time points), **descriptive statistics** are sufficient. Inferential statistics are only needed if you want to generalize or compare groups.\n   :::\n\n3. ### Should I use one Excel sheet or multiple for both CRNA-level and hospital-level data?\n   ::: {.faq-answer}\n   Use **one Excel file with two tabs** (worksheets):  \n   - One for CRNA responses  \n   - One for hospital-level data  \n   Include a shared column like \"Hospital ID\" for linking.\n   :::\n\n4. ### Do I need unique identifiers for one-time anonymous surveys?\n   ::: {.faq-answer}\n   No, not for one-time anonymous surveys. But use them if you want to link responses later.\n   :::\n\n5. ### How many Likert scale questions are recommended per topic for analysis?\n   ::: {.faq-answer}\n   Aim for **3–5 questions per topic** to ensure reliable measurement while keeping the survey short.\n   :::\n\n6. ### Tips on generating anonymous but trackable unique identifiers?\n   ::: {.faq-answer}\n   Use a self-generated code from personal but non-identifiable info (e.g., first 2 letters of mother's first name + last 2 digits of birth year + last letter of city born in). Always pilot-test for uniqueness.\n   :::\n\n7. ### What statistical tests are suitable for qualitative data?\n   ::: {.faq-answer}\n   Qualitative data should be analyzed with **thematic analysis or coding**. Present counts of how often themes appear and use example quotes.\n   :::\n\n8. ### Does project type affect software choice for statistics?\n   ::: {.faq-answer}\n   Yes. For **QI projects**, Excel and online calculators [t-test](https://modeling.nursing.uc.edu/statspicker/ttest.Rmd) or [chi-square](https://modeling.nursing.uc.edu/statspicker/chimc.Rmd) are enough. For complex stats, consider software like **SPSS or JMP**.\n   :::\n\n9. ### Is Chi-square used for analyzing how questionnaire responses affect rates of screenings, diagnoses, or referrals?\n   ::: {.faq-answer}\n   Yes, when both variables are categorical (e.g., \"yes/no\" responses and completion of screening).\n   :::\n\n10. ### Recommended YouTube or instructional videos for learning statistics in Excel?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    - Leila Gharani (Excel tutorials)\n    - StatQuest with Josh Starmer\n    - University of Cincinnati’s tools ([t-test](https://modeling.nursing.uc.edu/statspicker/ttest.Rmd) or [chi-square](https://modeling.nursing.uc.edu/statspicker/chimc.Rmd))\n    :::\n\n11. ### How to keep unique identifiers in EMR/MyChart QI projects?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Don’t use names or MRNs. Generate a **study-specific code**, and ensure the exported data is de-identified.\n    :::\n\n12. ### How to run multiple statistical tests with one data table?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Create a table with columns for:\n    - Variable or question\n    - Group 1 result\n    - Group 2 result\n    - P-value  \n    Use footnotes to explain test types.\n    :::\n\n13. ### How to choose the right statistical test for mixed yes/no results and average scores in small QI cycles?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    - Yes/no or categories: Chi-square or McNemar’s\n    - Averages: T-test (independent or paired)\n    Use descriptive stats first.\n    :::\n\n14. ### For small data sets, how to draw useful conclusions without power analysis?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Focus on **trends or patterns**, percent change, or confidence intervals. Describe improvements qualitatively and use graphs.\n    :::\n\n15. ### Dealing with missing survey answers or chart audit gaps?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Note the **percent missing** (surveys). Add a “Data Present (Y/N)” column for audits. Report frequency of missing data for transparency.\n    :::\n\n16. ### How to verify pre/post quiz score improvements reflect learning, not just question remembering?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Use a **Paired t-test** for pre/post score comparison. Change question order or use equivalent but different questions to minimize memory bias.\n    :::\n\n17. ### Does using a self-created Likert scale affect pre/post-test validity and use of paired t-test?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    It may affect validity but you can still use a paired t-test. Report that it’s a new scale and consider pilot testing for clarity.\n    :::\n\n18. ### How to store data for analyses involving both surveys and simulation scores?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Use one Excel file with separate tabs for surveys and simulation scores. Keep a consistent ID to match participants.\n    :::\n\n19. ### Is it better to store Likert responses as words or numbers?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Either is fine—just be consistent and include a codebook or key to explain.\n    :::\n\n20. ### How to get consent to add a study at a clinical site?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Check for **IRB approval**. Use a brief consent script/form stating:  \n    - Who you are  \n    - The study purpose  \n    - Voluntary/confidential participation\n    :::\n\n21. ### What if intervention isn’t allowed at my clinical site?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Focus on **current state assessment**; consider surveys, interviews, policy comparisons, or education evaluations instead.\n    :::\n\n22. ### Best ways to organize data collection for large projects?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Use Excel with clear headers, each row as one participant. Separate tabs by data type. Label and back up files regularly.\n    :::\n\n23. ### How to code data for privacy and IRB standards?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Remove all direct identifiers and use non-identifying study codes. Save the ID key separately and securely.\n    :::\n\n24. ### When should data collection pause or end for QI projects?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Stop when you’ve reached your target, completed a QI cycle, or are seeing consistent, unchanging themes.\n    :::\n\n25. ### Best platforms for data collection and analysis besides Excel?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    - REDCap (best for surveys/audit)\n    - SurveyMonkey or Google Forms (simple)\n    - JMP or SPSS for advanced statistics\n    :::\n\n26. ### Can email addresses be used as unique identifiers in Google Forms?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    No, emails are not anonymous. Use self-generated codes.\n    :::\n\n27. ### Can question styles be mixed in pre and post surveys?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Yes, as long as they are consistent between pre and post and are clearly organized.\n    :::\n\n28. ### Ideal number of questions on pre/post surveys?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    5–10 focused questions, grouped by theme, is ideal.\n    :::\n\n29. ### How to report percentages for screening tool answers? Are further tests needed?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Percentages and bar graphs are fine. For paired pre/post comparisons, consider McNemar’s test.\n    :::\n\n30. ### Can surveys and interviews be used for community needs assessments?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Yes. Keep surveys focused and interviews thematically coded; charts or counts can support findings.\n    :::\n\n31. ### Advice for using surveys in CPG (clinical practice guideline) development?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Gather end-user input to tailor the CPG and ensure it reflects their needs.\n    :::\n\n32. ### Should CPG effectiveness be evaluated by patient outcomes or APN feedback?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Use the measure that aligns best with your goals. Patient outcomes show clinical impact; APN input shows usability.\n    :::\n\n33. ### Best practices for pre/post-test question quantity and reliability?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Opt for 5–10 clear, relevant questions for reliable measurement.\n    :::\n\n34. ### How to use Excel's Analysis Toolpak vs. a t-test calculator?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    - **Analysis Toolpak**: More manual, keeps data organized  \n    - **Calculator**: Faster/easier for one-off tests [t-test](https://modeling.nursing.uc.edu/statspicker/ttest.Rmd) or [chi-square](https://modeling.nursing.uc.edu/statspicker/chimc.Rmd)\n    Use whichever is most comfortable and accessible.\n    :::\n\n35. ### How to improve statistical literacy for nurse educators and researchers?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Take formal statistics courses, watch YouTube tutorials (StatQuest, Leila Gharani), and seek out free online materials.\n    :::\n\n36. ### How do you assign unique identifiers?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Either self-generated codes (using non-identifiable info) or simply sequential IDs (001, 002, etc.).\n    :::\n\n37. ### How do you determine which software/tool to use for data collection and analysis?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Beginners: Microsoft Forms, SurveyMonkey, Excel.  \n    Advanced: Qualtrics, REDCap, JMP, SPSS, R, or Python.  \n    Choose what fits your skill and time, use tools you already know if short on time.\n    :::\n\n38. ### Any additional advice for choosing pre/post evaluation scales?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    Use validated scales with clear scoring and good reported reliability.\n    :::\n\n39. ### Should we calculate a p-value in QI projects with small samples?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    You can, but focus on direction and clinical relevance rather than statistical significance.\n    :::\n\n40. ### Best ways to present statistical data visually?\n    ::: {.faq-answer}\n    - **Bar charts** for categorical comparisons  \n    - **Box plots** for score changes  \n    - **Line graphs** for trends  \n    - **Pie charts** for demographics (sparingly)\n    :::\n\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\nThis page presents frequently asked statistics questions by students related to QI and EBP final projects.
