The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations.\" \n\nA researcher, who just completed Dr. Lambert's NPHD9040 HW 5 was interested in what factors contribute to health status in general. The researcher knew, that the Dataset used for HW1 had four health status variables. (ph, mh, cc, flu). They wondered what factors would be associated if they combined them into one variable, labeled AnyHealthIssue and used that as the outcome variable. This variable would be a 1 if the subject had any of the four health issues in the last 30 days, and 0 if they hadn't had any of them. With this new categorical dichotomous outcome variable in hand the knew they would need to do logistic regression. Using this dataset, investigate the relationships between the possible independent variables and the outcome AnyHealthIssue using logistic regression and multiple logistic regression.  Complete (atleast) the following items for your investigation:\n\n1.  Draw a conceptual framework figure on how you think the available variables connect with each other and the outcome.\n\n2.  Make graphs to investigate the associations.\n\n3.  Then use logistic regression with each variable separately. Report estimates in table 1 below.\n\n4.  Then, make a multiple logistic regression mode with the significant variables.  Report estimates in table 2 below.\n\n5.  How well did these models fit?\n\n6.  Report your findings in words as well as other interesting tidbits you found along the way.\n\n7.
