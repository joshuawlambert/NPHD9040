Open RStudio.\n2.  In the Console pane, type `R.version.string` and press Enter.\n3.

Create a vector called `height_cm` with the following values: `165, 170, 178, 160, 182`\n2.  Create a vector called `weight_kg` with the following values: `68, 75, 82, 55, 90`\n3.  Create a vector called `sbp` (Systolic Blood Pressure) with values: `120, 135, 140, 115, 150`\n\n**produce**:\n*   **Code**: The R commands to create these three vectors.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Hint\nReview how to create vectors using the `c()` function in [Getting Started with R](../Lectures/getting-started-with-r.qmd#vectors).\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| label: create-vectors\n\n# Your code here\n```\n\n# Question 3: Calculations and Dataframes\n\n**Task**: Perform calculations on vectors and combine them.\n\n1.  Create a new vector `height_m` by dividing `height_cm` by 100.\n2.  Calculate `bmi` using the formula: $BMI = \\frac{weight_{kg}}{height_m^2}$.\n3.  Combine `height_cm`, `weight_kg`, `sbp`, and `bmi` into a data frame called `health_data`.\n4.
