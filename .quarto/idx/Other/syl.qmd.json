Select the\nappropriate multivariate analysis method based on research objectives\nand types of variables to be analyzed. 2. Generate required sample size\nand power for prototypical analyses by multivariate method, concurrently\naddressing inclusion of under-represented groups in research. 3. Display\nan introductory level ability to manage data and conduct preliminary\nanalyses to assess and address data quality and potential violations of\nstatistical assumptions by multivariate method. 4.
