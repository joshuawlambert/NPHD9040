Conduct a simple linear regression where the response is SBP and the Independent variable is Age. What are the regression coefficients? What is the R Squared for the model?  What is the Null and Alternative Hypothesis for effect of Age? Is age significant? Interpret the effect of age regardless if it is significant.  \n\n\n\n\n\n| Subject ID | Age | Systolic.Blood.Pressure |\n|-----------:|:---:|:-----------------------:|\n|          1 | 20  |           100           |\n|          2 | 21  |           110           |\n|          3 | 24  |           140           |\n|          4 | 25  |           140           |\n|          5 | 26  |           125           |\n|          6 | 30  |           135           |\n|          7 | 24  |           115           |\n",
