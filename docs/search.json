    "section": "Preliminary Steps for Data Analysis",
    "text": "Preliminary Steps for Data Analysis\nBefore conducting statistical analyses in R, it’s crucial to follow these steps:\n\nDefine Your Research Question and Hypothesis\n\nResearch Question: Start with a clear, concise research question relevant to your primary interest.\nHypothesis: Formulate a testable statement that answers your research question.\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀): Represents no effect or difference.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): Represents an effect or difference.\n\n\nExample: - Research Question: Does a new pain management intervention reduce pain scores compared to standard care? - H₀: The mean pain score is the same for both groups. - Hₐ: The mean pain score differs between groups.\n\n\nPick Appropriate Variables and Measures\n\nIdentify key variables relevant to your research question.\nChoose between continuous or categorical variables based on the type of data available.\n\nContinuous Variables: Unlimited set of values (e.g., weight, age, blood pressure).\nCategorical Variables: Limited set of values (e.g., treatment status, diagnosis).\n\nOrdinal: Ordered categories (e.g., pain rating - low, medium, high).\nNominal: Unordered categories (e.g., sex - male, female).\nDichotomous: Only two levels (e.g., yes/no, treatment/control).\n\n\n\n\n💡 R Tip: In R, categorical variables should be stored as factors. Use factor() to convert character variables to factors, especially for ordinal data where you can specify the order.\n\n\n# Convert to factor\npain_level &lt;- factor(c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\", \"low\", \"high\"))\n\n# Ordered factor (for ordinal data)\npain_level &lt;- factor(c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\", \"low\", \"high\"),\n                     levels = c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"),\n                     ordered = TRUE)\n\n\n\nUnderstand the P-Value: Pros and Cons\n\nThe p-value is a statistical measure that helps assess evidence against the null hypothesis.\nPros:\n\nEasy to interpret.\nHelps determine statistical significance.\n\nCons:\n\nOften misinterpreted (e.g., “significant” does not always imply clinical relevance).\nCan be misleading in the presence of small sample sizes.\nDoes not measure effect size or practical importance.\n\n\n\n💡 R Tip: In R, p-values are typically found in the output of statistical tests. Look for columns labeled Pr(&gt;|t|), p-value, or similar. A common threshold is p &lt; 0.05 for statistical significance.\n\n\n\nDetermine Sample Size and Power\n\nSample Size: Ensure that the proposed sample is large enough to answer your research question confidently.\nPower Analysis: Conduct a power analysis to determine the minimum sample size required.\n\nPower: Probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis (typically 0.80 or 80%).\nType I Error (α): Probability of a false positive (usually 0.05).\nType II Error (β): Probability of a false negative (usually 0.20).\n\nFactors Influencing Power:\n\nEffect size\nSignificance level\nSample size\n\n\n\nPower Analysis in R\nR has the pwr package for power calculations:\n\n# Install the package (only once)\ninstall.packages(\"pwr\")\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(pwr)\n\n# Example: Power analysis for t-test\n# What sample size do we need to detect a medium effect (d=0.5)\n# with 80% power at alpha=0.05?\npwr.t.test(d = 0.5,           # Effect size (Cohen's d)\n           sig.level = 0.05,   # Alpha\n           power = 0.80,       # Desired power\n           type = \"two.sample\")\n\n# Example: What power do we have with n=30 per group?\npwr.t.test(n = 30,\n           d = 0.5,\n           sig.level = 0.05,\n           type = \"two.sample\")\n\n\n💡 R Tip: Common effect sizes (Cohen’s d): small = 0.2, medium = 0.5, large = 0.8. The pwr package has functions for many test types: pwr.t.test(), pwr.anova.test(), pwr.chisq.test(), etc.\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Data in R\n\nSetting Up Your Workspace\n\n# Check your current working directory\ngetwd()\n\n# Set working directory to where your data is stored\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/NPHD9040\")\n\n# Or use RStudio: Session → Set Working Directory → Choose Directory\n\n\n💡 R Tip: Keep all files for a project in one folder. This makes it easier to manage your data, scripts, and output.\n\n\n\nReading Data into R\nFor a more detailed guide on importing different file types (including using the RStudio GUI), see the Getting Started with R module.\n\n# Read CSV file\nmy_data &lt;- read.csv(\"patient_data.csv\")\n\n# Select file interactively\n# my_data &lt;- read.csv(file.choose())\n\n# Read CSV with specific options\nmy_data &lt;- read.csv(\"patient_data.csv\",\n                    header = TRUE,        # First row contains column names\n                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)  # Don't auto-convert to factors\n\n# For Excel files, use readxl package\nlibrary(readxl)\nmy_data &lt;- read_excel(\"patient_data.xlsx\")\n\n# View the data\nView(my_data)  # Opens in spreadsheet viewer\nhead(my_data)  # First 6 rows\ntail(my_data)  # Last 6 rows\n\n\n\n\nTaking Your Data on a Date: Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nCollect Consistent and High-Quality Data:\n\nUse secure electronic records whenever possible (e.g., REDCap).\nConsult the Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning data collection.\nTake note of possible biases or skewed observations that may affect results.\n\nTransform and Organize Data:\n\nRaw Data: Direct data collected from your research.\nTidy Data: Organized and transformed version of raw data.\nApply necessary transformations (e.g., standardization) to clean your data.\n\nConduct Exploratory Data Analysis:\n\nSummarize your data using basic descriptive statistics.\nVisualize your data through various graphs (e.g., histograms, box plots).\nIdentify potential differences and insights within or between groups.\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics in R\n\n# Summary statistics for all variables\nsummary(my_data)\n\n# Mean, median, standard deviation for a specific variable\nmean(my_data$age)\nmedian(my_data$age)\nsd(my_data$age)\n\n# Remove missing values with na.rm = TRUE\nmean(my_data$age, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Frequency table for categorical variables\ntable(my_data$treatment_group)\n\n# Cross-tabulation\ntable(my_data$treatment_group, my_data$outcome_category)\n\n# Proportions\nprop.table(table(my_data$treatment_group))\n\n\n💡 R Tip: Use str(my_data) to see the structure of your data frame. This shows variable names, types, and first few values - very helpful for understanding your data!\n\n\n\nChecking for Missing Data\n\n# Check for missing values\nsum(is.na(my_data))  # Total missing values\n\n# Missing values per variable\ncolSums(is.na(my_data))\n\n# Identify rows with any missing values\nmy_data[!complete.cases(my_data), ]\n\n# Remove rows with missing values (use with caution!)\nmy_data_complete &lt;- na.omit(my_data)"

    "text": "Post-hoc Analysis\nPost-hoc analysis is essential in ANOVA to identify specific group differences following the detection of a significant F-statistic. This analysis involves comparing all possible pairs of group means to determine which differences are statistically significant.\n\nThe Problem of Multiple Comparisons\nWhen we conduct multiple statistical tests simultaneously, the probability of making at least one Type I error (a false positive) increases. This is known as Alpha Inflation or the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER).\nIf you conduct one test at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), there is a 5% chance of a false positive. However, if you compare 3 groups, you have 3 possible pairwise comparisons. The probability of making at least one error is: \\[1 - (1 - 0.05)^3 \\approx 0.14 \\text{ or 14%}\\]\nTo protect against this, we must use one of two strategies:\n\nAdjust the Alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)): Lower the threshold for significance for each individual test (e.g., the Bonferroni method uses \\(\\alpha / \\text{number of tests}\\)).\nAdjust the P-values: Keep the \\(\\alpha\\) at 0.05 but “penalize” the p-values by making them larger based on the number of comparisons.\n\n\n\nTukey HSD vs Bonferroni\nTukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test and the Bonferroni correction are both methods used to manage these multiple comparisons.\n\nTukey’s HSD: Specifically designed for pairwise comparisons of all group means. It adjusts the p-values and confidence intervals to maintain the family-wise error rate at exactly 0.05.\nBonferroni Correction: The most conservative method. It simply divides your overall alpha (0.05) by the number of comparisons. For 3 comparisons, you would only call a result significant if \\(p &lt; 0.0167\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nTukey HSD in R\n\n# Tukey HSD post-hoc test\ntukey_result &lt;- TukeyHSD(model)\nprint(tukey_result)\n\n# Plot the results\nplot(tukey_result)\n\n# The output shows:\n# - diff: Difference in means\n# - lwr, upr: 95% confidence interval\n# - p adj: Adjusted p-value\n\n\n💡 R Tip: If the confidence interval for a pairwise comparison does not include 0, the difference is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.\n\n\n\nPairwise t-tests with Bonferroni Correction\n\n# Pairwise t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment\npairwise.t.test(data$stress, data$group, p.adjust.method = \"bonferroni\")"

We create them using c() (combine):\n\n# Numeric vector\nages &lt;- c(25, 34, 45, 56, 67)\nages\n\n[1] 25 34 45 56 67\n\n# Character vector\ntreatments &lt;- c(\"Placebo\", \"Drug A\", \"Drug B\", \"Placebo\", \"Drug A\")\ntreatments\n\n[1] \"Placebo\" \"Drug A\"  \"Drug B\"  \"Placebo\" \"Drug A\" \n\n# Access individual elements using brackets []\nages[1]  # First element\n\n[1] 25\n\nages[3]  # Third element\n\n[1] 45\n\n# Access multiple elements\nages[c(1, 3, 5)]  # First, third, and fifth elements\n\n[1] 25 45 67\n\n\n\n💡 R Tip: R uses 1-based indexing, meaning the first element is at position 1 (not 0 like some other languages).\n\n\n\nData Frames\nData frames are like spreadsheets - they have rows and columns. This is how we typically work with data in R:\n\n# Create a simple data frame\npatient_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  patient_id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n  age = c(25, 34, 45, 56, 67),\n  treatment = c(\"Placebo\", \"Drug A\", \"Drug B\", \"Placebo\", \"Drug A\"),\n  outcome = c(5.2, 6.8, 7.1, 5.5, 6.9)\n)\n\n# View the data frame\npatient_data\n\n  patient_id age treatment outcome\n1          1  25   Placebo     5.2\n2          2  34    Drug A     6.8\n3          3  45    Drug B     7.1\n4          4  56   Placebo     5.5\n5          5  67    Drug A     6.9\n\n# View structure of the data frame\nstr(patient_data)\n\n'data.frame':   5 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ patient_id: num  1 2 3 4 5\n $ age       : num  25 34 45 56 67\n $ treatment : chr  \"Placebo\" \"Drug A\" \"Drug B\" \"Placebo\" ...\n $ outcome   : num  5.2 6.8 7.1 5.5 6.9\n\n# View first few rows\nhead(patient_data)\n\n  patient_id age treatment outcome\n1          1  25   Placebo     5.2\n2          2  34    Drug A     6.8\n3          3  45    Drug B     7.1\n4          4  56   Placebo     5.5\n5          5  67    Drug A     6.9\n\n# Access a column using $\npatient_data$age\n\n[1] 25 34 45 56 67\n\n# Access a column using brackets\npatient_data[, \"treatment\"]\n\n[1] \"Placebo\" \"Drug A\"  \"Drug B\"  \"Placebo\" \"Drug A\" \n\n# Access a specific cell [row, column]\npatient_data[2, 3]  # Row 2, Column 3\n\n[1] \"Drug A\"\n\n\n\n\nFunctions\nFunctions perform operations. They have a name followed by parentheses containing arguments:\n\n# Calculate mean (average)\nmean(ages)\n\n[1] 45.4\n\n# Calculate standard deviation\nsd(ages)\n\n[1] 16.772\n\n# Calculate median\nmedian(ages)\n\n[1] 45\n\n# Summary statistics\nsummary(ages)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   25.0    34.0    45.0    45.4    56.0    67.0 \n\n# Count number of elements\nlength(ages)\n\n[1] 5\n\n# Create a table of frequencies\ntable(treatments)\n\ntreatments\n Drug A  Drug B Placebo \n      2       1       2 \n\n\n\n💡 R Tip: To learn about any function, type ?function_name in the console (e.g., ?mean)."

    "text": "Working with Data\n\nSetting Your Working Directory\nThe working directory is where R looks for files and saves output:\n\n# Check current working directory\ngetwd()\n\n# Set working directory (use your own path)\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/R_Projects\")\n\n# Or use Session → Set Working Directory → Choose Directory in RStudio\n\n\n💡 R Tip: Use forward slashes / in file paths, even on Windows. Or use double backslashes \\\\.\n\n\n\nReading Data from CSV Files\nCSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are common for data storage. There are three main ways to read them:\n\n1. Direct File Path\nBest for reproducibility (your script will always know where to look).\n\n# Read a CSV file by providing the path\nmy_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/patient_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n2. Interactive Selection (file.choose)\nUseful if you don’t know the exact path or want to “browse” for the file.\n\n# This will open a window for you to select the file manually\nmy_data &lt;- read.csv(file.choose())\n\n\n💡 R Tip: file.choose() is great for beginners, but for formal research, typing the path (Method 1) is better because it makes your work “reproducible” - anyone can run your script without having to click through windows.\n\n\n\n3. RStudio “Import Dataset” Tool\nThe easiest way for beginners. RStudio has a built-in “point-and-click” importer:\n\nIn the Environment pane (top right), click Import Dataset.\nSelect From Text (base)… (for CSV) or From Excel….\nBrowse to your file.\nPreview the data and check the options (e.g., Heading, Separator).\nClick Import.\n\n\n💡 R Tip: When you use the Import Tool, RStudio actually runs the read.csv() or read_excel() code in the console. You should copy that code and paste it into your script so you can re-run it later!\n\n\n\nExamining the Data\nOnce imported, always check your data:\n\n# View the first few rows\nhead(my_data)\n\n# View the structure (variable names and types)\nstr(my_data)\n\n# View the entire dataset in a spreadsheet-like viewer\nView(my_data)\n\n\n\n\nReading Data from Excel Files\nTo read Excel files, you need the readxl package:\n\n# Install the package (only needed once)\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\")\n\n# Load the package (needed each session)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n# Read an Excel file\nmy_data &lt;- read_excel(\"data_file.xlsx\")\n\n# Read a specific sheet\nmy_data &lt;- read_excel(\"data_file.xlsx\", sheet = \"Sheet1\")"

    "text": "Download R Code for this Lecture\n\nUnderstanding Hypothesis Testing and ANCOVA\n\nDefinition and Purpose of ANCOVA\nAnalysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) is a statistical method that combines ANOVA and regression. It assesses the main and interaction effects of categorical variables on a continuous outcome while controlling for the influence of one or more continuous covariates.\n\n\nKey Differences Between ANCOVA and ANOVA\n\nANOVA examines differences in means between groups without adjusting for other variables.\nANCOVA adjusts group means to account for the effect of covariates.\n\n\n\nAssumptions of ANCOVA\n\nThe dependent variable is measured on an interval or ratio scale.\nThe independent variable is categorical.\nCovariates are measured on an interval or ratio scale.\nRandom sampling.\nNormal distribution of the dependent variable.\nHomogeneity of variance.\nHomogeneity of regression slopes between groups.\n\n\n\nIndependent Variables and Covariates\n\nIndependent Variables: Categorical factors of interest.\nCovariates: Continuous variables used to adjust the dependent variable.\n\n\n\nVisualizing ANCOVA\nVisualizing ANCOVA often involves making line plots to show the trajectory of the independent variable (x-axis) and dependent variable (y-axis) by group (color). One of the assumptions of an ANCOVA is “Homogeneity of regression slopes between groups”. As we can see in this graph, there doesn’t seem to be graphical evidence for that. Use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the predictor and outcome variables. For more on creating these visualizations in R, see the Graphing Your Data lecture.\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see here, this example shows slopes that are much more similar. Thats good because if we are going to use ANCOVA, we are assuming they are the same or atleast very similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Example visualization in R\n        library(ggplot2)\n\n        data &lt;- data.frame(\n          group = rep(c(\"Placebo\", \"Behavioral\", \"Drug\"), each = 10),\n          pre_stress = rnorm(30, 5, 1),\n          post_stress = c(rnorm(10, 5, 1), rnorm(10, 7, 1), rnorm(10, 6, 1))\n        )\n\n        # Interaction plot\n        ggplot(data, aes(x = pre_stress, y = post_stress, color = group)) +\n          geom_point() +\n          geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n          labs(title = \"Interaction Plot\", x = \"Pre-Stress Score\", y = \"Post-Stress Score\")\n\n\n\nCalculation of Adjusted Means\nAdjusted means, or least-squares means, are averages that account for the influence of covariates. They are particularly useful in analyses like ANCOVA to provide unbiased comparisons across groups by removing the effects of nuisance variables. This adjustment ensures that the differences between groups reflect the effect of the primary variables of interest, not the covariates. Thus, adjusted means enable a fair comparison of group differences after controlling for external influences.\n\n# Adjusted means in R\n        library(car)\n        model &lt;- lm(post_stress ~ group + pre_stress, data = data)\n        Anova(model, type = 3)\n        lsmeans &lt;- emmeans::emmeans(model, \"group\")\n        print(lsmeans)\n\n\n\nTesting Main Effects and Investigating the Interaction\nTesting main effects reveals the individual impact of each independent and covariate variable on the outcome. Investigating interaction effects uncovers how combinations of these variables jointly influence the outcome. Together, they provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships within the data, guiding more accurate interpretations and conclusions about our ANCOVA result.\n\nMain Effects: The impact of each independent and covariate variable on the outcome.\nInteraction Effects: How combinations of independent and covariate variables influence the outcome.\n\n\n# Testing main effects and interaction in R\n        model &lt;- lm(post_stress ~ group * pre_stress, data = data)\n        Anova(model, type = 3)\n\n\n\nEffect Sizes and Significance, F Test, SSC, SSB, SSW, P-value\n\nF Test: Determines if group means are significantly different.\nSSB (Sum of Squares Between): Measures variation between groups.\nSSC (Sum of Squares Covariate): Measures the variation explained by the covariate.\nSSW (Sum of Squares Within): Measures variation within groups.\nP-value: Indicates statistical significance.\n\n\n# Effect sizes and significance in R\n        model &lt;- lm(post_stress ~ group + pre_stress, data = data)\n        Anova(model, type = 3)\n\n\n\nExamples of ANCOVA in Nursing Research\n\nPatient Recovery Rates: Comparing patient recovery rates across different treatment groups while controlling for age and baseline health status.\nStress Reduction Programs: Evaluating the effectiveness of stress reduction programs while controlling for initial stress levels.\n\n\n\nHands-on Example: Interpreting Your Results\ndownload ex. 1 data (CSV)\n\n# Example ANCOVA in R\n        model &lt;- lm(post_stress ~ group + pre_stress, data = data)\n        summary(model)\n        Anova(model, type = 3)"

    "section": "Questions",
    "text": "Questions\nQ1: What’s the best statistical test to compare CRNA autonomy levels (supervised vs collaborative) between different types of counties (urban vs rural)? I was thinking chi square, but I want to make sure that makes sense.\nA1: Yes, Chi-square is appropriate. You’re comparing two categorical variables (autonomy level: supervised vs. collaborative, and county type: urban vs. rural), so Chi-square is the best fit.\nUse this tool: Chi-square Calculator\n\nQ2: Since I’m not doing a clinical intervention, just collecting current state data from hospitals, is it okay to stick with descriptive stats (like percentages and means), or do I need to run inferential tests too?\nA2: No, you don’t need inferential stats. Descriptive statistics (percentages, averages) are totally fine for quality improvement (QI) projects focused on current state. Only use inferential stats if you’re comparing groups or time points and trying to generalize beyond your sample.\n\nQ3: If I’m collecting both CRNA-level responses (autonomy and perception) and hospital level info (billing model and policy), should all that data be on one Excel sheet or split into two?\nA3: Use one Excel file but two separate tabs (worksheets):\n\nOne tab for CRNA responses (autonomy, perception, etc.)\nOne tab for hospital-level data (billing model, policy, etc.)\n\nIf you’re linking them, include a shared column like “Hospital ID.”\n\nQ4: Do I need to assign unique identifiers if I’m not doing a pre/post design just one time surveys?\nA4: You do not need unique identifiers for one-time anonymous surveys. But include one if you think you might later want to link responses (like if doing subgroup analysis by site or unit).\n\nQ5: I want to include Likert scale questions about autonomy, efficiency, and OR delays. Is there a recommended number of questions to include so I can run an analysis later?\nA5: Aim for 3–5 questions per topic (e.g., 3 for autonomy, 3 for efficiency, etc.). This helps you measure a concept more reliably while keeping the survey short.\n\nQ6: Any tips on picking unique identifiers that allows participants to be anonymous, but still allows me to track pre and post answers?\nA6: Create a self-generated code from a mix of personal but not-identifying elements. For example:\n\nFirst 2 letters of mother’s first name + last 2 digits of birth year + last letter of city born in (e.g., “Ma89o”)\n\nAlways test it to make sure it creates unique results across your sample.\n\nQ7: Do you have a recommendation on statistical tests for qualitative data?\nA7: Qualitative data isn’t analyzed with statistical tests. Instead, use thematic analysis or coding. You can present counts of how often certain themes appear, or quotes to highlight key points.\n\nQ8: How do we obtain statistical software? Does the type of project matter pertaining to software?\nA8: Yes. If you’re doing QI (not formal research), Excel and online calculators are usually enough. If you’re doing complex stats, you may need SPSS or JMP. Use tools you’re comfortable with.\n\nQ9: Chi-square—So would this test be used for how a patient questionnaire affects rate of x (screenings, diagnosis, referral rates)?\nA9: Yes, if both variables are categorical. For example:\n\nPatient said yes/no on questionnaire (yes/no)\nScreening completed (yes/no)\n\nThen a Chi-square test works great.\n\nQ10: Best YouTube/instructional videos for learning statistics in Excel?\nA10: Try:\n\nLeila Gharani (excellent Excel tutorials)\nStatQuest with Josh Starmer (stats made simple)\nUniversity of Cincinnati’s own tools:\n\nT-test Tool\nChi-square Tool\n\n\n\nQ11: Keeping track of unique identifiers if we use something like an EMR, MyChart, etc. to administer whatever tool is being used for the project?\nA11: Don’t use names or MRNs. Instead:\n\nGenerate a study-specific code tied to a non-identifying feature (e.g., date/time stamp + 2-digit code)\nMake sure data is exported de-identified\n\n\nQ12: How would you run multiple tests with one table?\nA12: Create a table with one row per variable or question, and columns for:\n\nGroup 1 result\nGroup 2 result\np-value\n\nLabel clearly and use footnotes to explain test types.\n\nQ13: When working with different types of data like yes/no results and average scores how do we choose the right statistical test for a small-scale quality improvement cycle?\nA13: - For yes/no or categories → Chi-square or McNemar’s (if paired) - For average scores → T-test (independent or paired)\nUse descriptive stats first. Inferential only if you compare groups or time points.\n\nQ14: If we only have a small amount of data during early testing, how can we still draw useful conclusions especially without doing a formal power analysis?\nA14: Focus on:\n\nTrends or patterns\nPercent change\n\nUse confidence intervals if possible. Even without formal power, describe improvements qualitatively and use graphs for impact.\n\nQ15: What are the best ways to deal with missing answers in surveys or gaps in chart audit data especially when it could affect results like process or balancing measures?\nA15: - For surveys: Note missing % and don’t replace unless critical - For chart audits: Add a column like “Data Present (Y/N)”. You can report how often data was missing to show transparency.\n\nQ16: When we look at quiz scores before and after a training module, how can we make sure any improvements show actual learning and not just remembering the questions from before?\nA16: Use a Paired t-test if comparing pre/post scores. To reduce memory bias:\n\nChange question order\nUse different but equivalent questions if possible\n\n\nQ17: When using a Likert scale, does it impact the validity of your pre- and post-test (utilizing a paired t-test for analysis) if the Likert scale used was created by you, as compared to using a Likert scale that has already proven validity?\nA17: Yes, it can affect validity, but not your ability to run a paired t-test. You can still analyze it. Just be transparent that it’s a new tool, and consider pilot testing it for clarity.\n\nQ18: I ask this question because I am examining the confidence of OR RNs in managing difficult airway situations through a pre- and post-test to determine how education affects their confidence. Given that my project is very specific, I believe it is necessary to create my own version of a Likert scale to tailor it to what I am attempting to evaluate.\nA18: Use one Excel file with separate tabs:\n\nTab 1: Survey responses\nTab 2: Simulation scores\n\nKeep consistent ID columns across tabs to match participants.\n\nQ19: For my project I am looking to do multiple analyses of my population, like a Likert-scale survey, and a scoring system for performance in completion of a simulation. Since I am having multiple variables that I am analyzing would I need to store the results in separate excel files and run the analysis separately?\nA19: Yes, either:\n\nWrite the word (e.g., “Strongly Agree”)\nOr assign a number (e.g., 1–5)\n\nJust be consistent. Add a key on your sheet to explain what each number means.\n\nQ20: If a Likert scale is used, do you just write out which category into the response column for that question?\nA20: Yes, that works or you can convert to a number system, although it may be difficult later to understand what number means. I would recommend using the label or a shortened version of the label as the category in the data row and column.\n\nQ21: What is the best way to get consent to add study at clinical site?\nA21: Check if IRB approval is needed. Then:\n\nUse a brief consent script or form\nInclude who you are, what the study is, that participation is voluntary and confidential\n\n\nQ22: If unable to have intervention at clinical site is there a specific project change you recommend?\nA22: If intervention isn’t allowed:\n\nFocus on current state assessment\nAdd interviews or surveys\nDo a policy comparison, or education evaluation\n\n\nQ23: What is the most effective way to organize the data from our study as it is being collected without the amount of data becoming overwhelming?\nA23: - Use Excel with clear headers (no spaces in names). First row is name of variable. - Keep each row = one participant or one encounter - Add tabs for demographics, survey, audit data, etc.\nLabel everything and back up your file often.\n\nQ24: To protect patient/practitioner privacy, what is the recommended or best way to code the data that will adhere to IRB standards?\nA24: - Remove all direct identifiers (name, DOB, MRN) - Use non-identifying study codes - Save ID key separately and securely (if needed)\n\nQ25: After initial data collection and evaluation, how long should we give to collect further data in order to make sure that we have covered enough ground in our collection process? How do you know that you have an adequate amount to move forward in your project’s progression vs knowing when to pause and continue to collect more data?\nA25: Enough to:\n\nReach your target number\nCapture full QI cycle\n\nYou’re ready to stop if:\n\nYou’re not seeing new themes\nData is consistent\nYou met your aim or timeline\n\n\nQ26: When creating the collection instrument and methodology of collection, what platforms did students in the past find to have provided most useful for analysis outside of Excel?\nA26: - REDCap (best for surveys + audit) - SurveyMonkey or Google Forms (simpler) - JMP or SPSS (for complex stats, if needed)\n\nQ27: Can Unique Identifiers be email addresses if you are using google forms to collect data?\nA27: No — emails are not anonymous. Use self-generated codes instead.\n\nQ28: Can you use a mix of question style like interviewing format and several word based question if its consistent for both pre and post survey questions?\nA28: Yes, as long as:\n\nThe same format is used in pre and post\nIt’s clearly matched and organized\n\n\nQ29: How many questions on the pre and post survey is ideal?\nA29: Aim for 5–10 focused questions. More than that can lower response quality. Group by theme (e.g., 3 for confidence, 3 for knowledge).\n\nQ30: I plan on using descriptive statistics to show demographic data. My intervention is going to be screening patients for depression and anxiety again at 12-14 weeks postpartum to determine if they feel more comfortable disclosing symptoms at that point. I plan on doing an interview with these patients as well. To show the results, would percentages be okay to show the answers for the screening tool? Or would there be another statistical test that would be more appropriate?\nA30: Yes, absolutely. Use percentages and bar graphs to show change over time. If you want to compare pre/post, and you used the same patients, you could consider McNemar’s test.\n\nQ31: My EBP project focuses on using mindfulness to reduce stress in parents of children with ADHD. Even though it’s not research, can I still use surveys and interviews for my community needs assessment? Are there any special considerations I should keep in mind for analyzing or reporting that data?\nA31: Yes. For QI, both are great. Just keep:\n\nSurveys focused\nInterviews transcribed and thematically coded\n\nYou don’t need formal stats, but you can use counts or charts to support findings.\n\nQ32: Best contact for questions? Will we get access to the tools she put in the recorded chat, for our usage?\nA32: Please either reach out to me directly: Joshua.lambert@uc.edu or submit a request here: https://redcap.research.cchmc.org/surveys/?s=FR3YH89KT8\n\nQ33: The only question I have is that she shared links to the T-test calculator and tookkit for excel, where can we find these links? Are they on the DNP community page?\nA33: Yes, they are on the DNP community page and they can be found here:\n\nT-test Tool\nChi-square Tool\n\n\nQ34: My DNP project involves developing a clinical practice guideline using the AGREE II tool. The second domain of the AGREE II tool, Stakeholder Involvement, emphasizes the importance of representing the views of the intended users, which for this project is advanced practice nurses (APNs). I plan to create and collect survey responses from APNs regarding the barriers they encounter to conducting comprehensive, whole-person assessments and evaluations in the ambulatory setting. This information will help guide the development of the CPG. Do you have any advice on using a survey to support CPG development?\nA34: - Identify barriers APNs face in conducting whole-person assessments - Understand workflow, time, resource, or training issues - Gather input for tailoring your CPG to be practical and relevant - Demonstrate that your CPG reflects end-user needs (supports AGREE II)\n\nQ35: The effectiveness of the CPG will be assessed using the Whole Person Health Index, an integrated, self-report measure that captures key health components. Is a patient outcome measure suitable for evaluating a CPG, or should I use an instrument to determine whether APNs find the CPG useful in practice?\nA35: - Patient outcomes show clinical impact - APN feedback shows usability\nUse what aligns best with your project goals.\n\nQ36: Do you have any other general recommendations on stats and evaluation for DNP projects that involve developing CPGs?\nA36: - Use a validated tool (like AGREE II) - Get stakeholder input - Keep results organized tool specific category\n\nQ37: What are the best practices for determining the appropriate number of questions for pre- and post-tests in statistical evaluation, and how might this influence the reliability of the results?\nA37: 5–10 solid, well-designed questions are better than 20 unclear ones. Focus on clarity and alignment with your outcome.\n\nQ38: How can I leverage tools like Excel’s Analysis Toolpak and other statistical platforms like the t-test calculator to perform accurate T-tests, and what are the pros and cons of each method in practical settings?\nA38: - Excel’s Analysis Toolpak is more manual but lets you keep data in one place - The T-test Tool is faster and gives a summary statement\nUse the calculator if you’re unsure how to run stats in Excel.\n\nQ39: In what ways can I improve my statistical literacy to ensure proper evaluation of program outcomes and instructional effectiveness even as I get ready to work on my project and work on becoming a future nurse educator?\nA39: You can always enroll in our PhD statistics classes as electives as time permits. There are lots of great YouTube videos and free resources online. StatQuest (YouTube) or Leila Gharani (excellent Excel tutorials)\n\nQ40: How does one obtain unique identifiers?\nA40: - Ask participants to create one using personal, non-identifying info - Or assign sequential IDs (001, 002, 003…)\n\nQ41: How do you really determine the right software or tool to utilize for data collection and analysis?\nA41: This can be difficult for beginners. Ultimately, picking one that matches your current ability is important. For beginners I recommend: Microsoft Forms, or Survey Monkey. For more advanced users Qualtrics and REDCap are great options. Choose based on what your time allows for.\nAnalysis is similar. Beginners should stick to excel, online DNP calculators and descriptive statistics. Advanced users can choose JMP (free), SPSS (paid), R or Python.\nIf you don’t have much time to commit to learning advanced software then I’d choose MF or SM and Excel, online calculators and descriptive statistics.\n\nQ42: Do you have any advice about choosing a scale for pre and post test? I have selected a scale that seems to measure my endpoint and is validated, but wanted to see if there is anything additional I should be considering?\nA42: If you’ve already picked a validated scale aligned with your endpoint, you’re in great shape. Just make sure it has:\n\nClear scoring\nGood reliability (check prior studies)\n\n\nQ43: Bailey had mentioned that she would not necessarily expect a statistically significant result with a small sample size. Would you still recommend calculating a p value with a quality improvement project on a single nursing unit?\nA43: You can, but be cautious about over-interpreting. Focus more on direction of change and clinical relevance.\n\nQ44: Would you recommend any specific types of graphs or ways to present statistical data for the dissemination of results?\nA44: - Bar charts for categorical comparisons - Box plots for score changes - Line graphs for trends over time - Pie charts for demographics (use sparingly)"
