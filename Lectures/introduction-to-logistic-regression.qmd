## Introduction

Logistic regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model
the relationship between a dependent variable (often binary) and one or
more independent variables. It is particularly useful in healthcare and
nursing research to understand the influence of various factors on
patient outcomes.

## Objectives

-   Understand the fundamentals of logistic regression.
-   Learn the key differences between logistic and linear regression.
-   Explore the logistic function and its interpretation.
-   Calculate and interpret odds ratios.
-   Formulate the logistic regression equation using maximum likelihood
    estimation (MLE).
-   Estimate and test the significance of the regression coefficients.
-   Explore goodness-of-fit tests and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
-   Learn about stepwise logistic regression.
-   Check assumptions and assess multicollinearity.
-   Provide examples in JMP, R, Python, SPSS, and Stata.

## Definition and Purpose of Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used to predict the probability of a binary
outcome (e.g., success/failure, disease/no disease) based on one or more
predictor variables. It helps in answering questions like: - What are
the chances that a patient has diabetes given their age, BMI, and family
history? - How likely is a patient to respond to a specific treatment
based on their health metrics?

## Key Differences Between Logistic Regression and Linear Regression

-   **Outcome Variable:** Logistic regression deals with binary
    outcomes, while linear regression handles continuous outcomes.
-   **Prediction Interpretation:** Logistic regression outputs
    probabilities (between 0 and 1) instead of continuous values.
-   **Model Fit Measure:** Logistic regression uses likelihood-based
    measures like deviance, while linear regression relies on metrics
    like R-squared.

## Understanding the Logistic Function and Its Interpretation

The logistic function transforms a linear combination of predictors into
probabilities:

$$ p = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \cdots + \beta_kX_k}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \cdots + \beta_kX_k}} $$

where ( p ) is the predicted probability, and ( \beta\_i ) are the
regression coefficients.

The log-odds (logit) transformation:

$$ \log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \cdots + \beta_kX_k $$

## Calculation and Interpretation of Odds Ratios

An odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association between an exposure and
an outcome. It is interpreted as the odds of the outcome occurring given
the presence of a particular predictor.

$$ \text{OR} = \exp(\beta_i) $$

-   **OR \> 1:** Positive association between predictor and outcome.
-   **OR \< 1:** Negative association between predictor and outcome.
-   **OR = 1:** No association.

## Formulating the Logistic Regression Equation; Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

1.  **Model Specification:**
    $$ \log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \cdots + \beta_kX_k $$

2.  **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** The logistic regression
    coefficients are estimated by maximizing the likelihood function:
    $$ L(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{1 - y_i} $$ where
    ( p_i ) is the predicted probability for the ( i )-th observation.

## Estimating the Regression Coefficients

The coefficients are estimated using MLE. Most statistical software
provides direct estimation.

## Testing the Significance of the Regression Coefficients

-   **Wald Test:** Tests individual coefficients.
-   **Likelihood Ratio Test:** Compares nested models.
-   **Score Test:** Similar to the likelihood ratio test.

## Confidence Intervals for the Coefficients

Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for the
coefficients.

$$ CI = \hat{\beta_i} \pm z^* \cdot SE(\hat{\beta_i}) $$

## Deviance and Goodness-of-Fit Tests

-   **Deviance:** Measure of model fit, similar to residual sum of
    squares.
-   **Likelihood Ratio Test (Chi-Square):** Compares the deviance of
    nested models.
-   **Hosmer-Lemeshow Test:** Assesses model calibration.

## Interpretation of Regression Coefficients; Understanding the Impact of Predictors on Odds

### Example

Assume a logistic regression model predicting diabetes (yes/no) based on
age and BMI:

$$ \log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = -5 + 0.05 \cdot \text{Age} + 0.2 \cdot \text{BMI} $$

Interpretation: - **Intercept (-5):** Baseline log-odds of diabetes for
a patient with Age = 0 and BMI = 0. - **Age Coefficient (0.05):** For
each one-year increase in age, the odds of diabetes increase by (
e\^{0.05} \approx 1.05 ) times. - **BMI Coefficient (0.2):** For each
unit increase in BMI, the odds of diabetes increase by ( e\^{0.2}
\approx 1.22 ) times.

## Stepwise Logistic Regression

Stepwise logistic regression involves automatic selection of predictors
based on criteria like AIC, BIC, or p-values.

-   **Forward Selection:** Starts with no variables and adds one at a
    time.
-   **Backward Elimination:** Starts with all variables and removes one
    at a time.
-   **Bidirectional Elimination:** Combines forward and backward
    methods.

## Interpreting Odds Ratios for Categorical and Continuous Predictors

-   **Categorical Predictors:** Interpret the OR relative to the
    reference category.
-   **Continuous Predictors:** Interpret the OR per unit increase in the
    predictor.

## Checking Assumptions of Logistic Regression

1.  **Linearity in Logit:** Ensure continuous predictors are linearly
    related to the logit.
2.  **Absence of Multicollinearity:** Check variance inflation factors
    (VIF).
3.  **No Outliers/Influential Observations:** Use Cook's distance or
    leverage plots.
