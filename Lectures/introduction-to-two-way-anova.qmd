## Definition and Purpose of Two-Way ANOVA

Two-Way ANOVA is a statistical test used to examine the impact of two
independent variables on a continuous dependent variable. It is an
extension of One-Way ANOVA but allows for the simultaneous evaluation of
two factors, making it suitable for analyzing more complex experimental
designs.

### Key Differences Between One-Way and Two-Way ANOVA

-   **One-Way ANOVA:** Evaluates the effect of a single independent
    variable on a continuous outcome.
-   **Two-Way ANOVA:** Evaluates the effects of two independent
    variables (factors), including any interaction between them.

## Understanding the Structure of a Two-Way ANOVA Design

In a Two-Way ANOVA, each factor (independent variable) can have multiple
levels. For example, in a clinical trial examining the effects of drug
dosage (Factor 1) and diet (Factor 2), the design might include: -
**Factor 1 (Dosage):** Low, Medium, High - **Factor 2 (Diet):** Control,
Low-Fat, High-Fat

### Main Effects and Interaction

-   **Main Effect:** The impact of one factor on the dependent variable,
    ignoring the levels of the other factor.
-   **Interaction Effect:** The combined effect of both factors on the
    dependent variable that is different from the sum of their
    individual effects.

## Assumptions of Two-Way ANOVA

### Normality of Residuals

Residuals (errors) should be normally distributed.

### Homogeneity of Variances

Variances should be approximately equal across all levels of the
factors.

## Calculation of SS (Sum of Squares) and MS (Mean Squares)

### Sum of Squares

-   **Total Sum of Squares (SST):** $$
    SST = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2
    $$ where ( Y_i ) is each individual observation, and ( \bar{Y} ) is
    the overall mean.

-   **Sum of Squares for Factor A (SSA):** $$
    SSA = \sum_{j=1}^{a} n_{j} (\bar{Y}_{j\cdot} - \bar{Y})^2
    $$ where ( n\_{j} ) is the number of observations in each level of
    Factor A, ( \bar{Y}\_{j\cdot} ) is the mean for each level of Factor

    A.  

-   **Sum of Squares for Factor B (SSB):** $$
    SSB = \sum_{k=1}^{b} n_{k} (\bar{Y}_{\cdot k} - \bar{Y})^2
    $$ where ( n\_{k} ) is the number of observations in each level of
    Factor B, ( \bar{Y}\_{\cdot k} ) is the mean for each level of
    Factor B.

-   **Sum of Squares for Interaction (SSAB):** $$
    SSAB = \sum_{j=1}^{a} \sum_{k=1}^{b} n_{jk} (\bar{Y}_{jk} - \bar{Y}_{j\cdot} - \bar{Y}_{\cdot k} + \bar{Y})^2
    $$ where ( \bar{Y}\_{jk} ) is the mean of each combination of levels
    in Factors A and B.

-   **Sum of Squares for Error (SSE):** $$
    SSE = \sum_{j=1}^{a} \sum_{k=1}^{b} \sum_{i=1}^{n_{jk}} (Y_{ijk} - \bar{Y}_{jk})^2
    $$

### Mean Squares

Mean Squares are obtained by dividing each Sum of Squares by the
corresponding degrees of freedom.

-   **Mean Square for Factor A (MSA):** $$
    MSA = \frac{SSA}{a - 1}
    $$

-   **Mean Square for Factor B (MSB):** $$
    MSB = \frac{SSB}{b - 1}
    $$

-   **Mean Square for Interaction (MSAB):** $$
    MSAB = \frac{SSAB}{(a - 1)(b - 1)}
    $$

-   **Mean Square for Error (MSE):** $$
    MSE = \frac{SSE}{ab(n - 1)}
    $$

## Hypothesis Testing for Main Effects and Interaction

### Hypotheses

-   **Factor A (Main Effect):**
    -   Null Hypothesis (( H_0 )): All levels of Factor A have the same
        mean.
    -   Alternative Hypothesis (( H_1 )): At least one level of Factor A
        has a different mean.
-   **Factor B (Main Effect):**
    -   Null Hypothesis (( H_0 )): All levels of Factor B have the same
        mean.
    -   Alternative Hypothesis (( H_1 )): At least one level of Factor B
        has a different mean.
-   **Interaction Effect:**
    -   Null Hypothesis (( H_0 )): No interaction between Factors A and
        B.  
    -   Alternative Hypothesis (( H_1 )): Interaction exists between
        Factors A and B.

### F-Ratio Calculations

-   **Factor A:** $$
    F_A = \frac{MSA}{MSE}
    $$

-   **Factor B:** $$
    F_B = \frac{MSB}{MSE}
    $$

-   **Interaction (A x B):** $$
    F_{AB} = \frac{MSAB}{MSE}
    $$

### Interpretation

-   Compare the F-ratios to the critical values from the F-distribution.
-   If the calculated F-ratio is greater than the critical value, reject
    the null hypothesis.

## Effect Sizes and Significance

### Eta Squared (( \eta\^2 ))

Represents the proportion of the total variance explained by each
factor.

-   **Factor A:** $$
    \eta^2_A = \frac{SSA}{SST}
    $$

-   **Factor B:** $$
    \eta^2_B = \frac{SSB}{SST}
    $$

-   **Interaction (A x B):** $$
    \eta^2_{AB} = \frac{SSAB}{SST}
    $$

## Post-Hoc Analysis

If significant main or interaction effects are found, post-hoc tests
(e.g., Tukey's HSD) can identify which specific groups differ.

### Tukey's HSD

$$
HSD = q \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n}}
$$ where ( q ) is the studentized range statistic, and ( n ) is the
sample size per group.

## Identifying Outliers and Influential Observations

### Normality

-   Use Q-Q plots to check the normality of residuals.

### Homogeneity of Variances

-   Use Levene's test or Bartlett's test.

### Outliers

-   Use residual plots or Cook's distance to identify influential
    points.

    pressure levels in patients?
