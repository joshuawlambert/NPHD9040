## Questions

::: {.faq}

1. ### What’s the best statistical test to compare CRNA autonomy levels (supervised vs collaborative) between different types of counties (urban vs rural)?
   ::: {.faq-answer}
   The **Chi-square test** is appropriate since you're comparing two categorical variables: autonomy level (supervised vs. collaborative) and county type (urban vs. rural).
   :::

2. ### Is it okay to use only descriptive stats for current state data, or do I need inferential tests too?
   ::: {.faq-answer}
   For QI projects that just describe the current state (no group comparisons/time points), **descriptive statistics** are sufficient. Inferential statistics are only needed if you want to generalize or compare groups.
   :::

3. ### Should I use one Excel sheet or multiple for both CRNA-level and hospital-level data?
   ::: {.faq-answer}
   Use **one Excel file with two tabs** (worksheets):  
   - One for CRNA responses  
   - One for hospital-level data  
   Include a shared column like "Hospital ID" for linking.
   :::

4. ### Do I need unique identifiers for one-time anonymous surveys?
   ::: {.faq-answer}
   No, not for one-time anonymous surveys. But use them if you want to link responses later.
   :::

5. ### How many Likert scale questions are recommended per topic for analysis?
   ::: {.faq-answer}
   Aim for **3–5 questions per topic** to ensure reliable measurement while keeping the survey short.
   :::

6. ### Tips on generating anonymous but trackable unique identifiers?
   ::: {.faq-answer}
   Use a self-generated code from personal but non-identifiable info (e.g., first 2 letters of mother's first name + last 2 digits of birth year + last letter of city born in). Always pilot-test for uniqueness.
   :::

7. ### What statistical tests are suitable for qualitative data?
   ::: {.faq-answer}
   Qualitative data should be analyzed with **thematic analysis or coding**. Present counts of how often themes appear and use example quotes.
   :::

8. ### Does project type affect software choice for statistics?
   ::: {.faq-answer}
   Yes. For **QI projects**, Excel and online calculators [t-test](https://modeling.nursing.uc.edu/statspicker/ttest.Rmd) or [chi-square](https://modeling.nursing.uc.edu/statspicker/chimc.Rmd) are enough. For complex stats, consider software like **SPSS or JMP**.
   :::

9. ### Is Chi-square used for analyzing how questionnaire responses affect rates of screenings, diagnoses, or referrals?
   ::: {.faq-answer}
   Yes, when both variables are categorical (e.g., "yes/no" responses and completion of screening).
   :::

10. ### Recommended YouTube or instructional videos for learning statistics in Excel?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
    - Leila Gharani (Excel tutorials)
    - StatQuest with Josh Starmer
    - University of Cincinnati’s tools ([t-test](https://modeling.nursing.uc.edu/statspicker/ttest.Rmd) or [chi-square](https://modeling.nursing.uc.edu/statspicker/chimc.Rmd))
    :::

11. ### How to keep unique identifiers in EMR/MyChart QI projects?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
    Don’t use names or MRNs. Generate a **study-specific code**, and ensure the exported data is de-identified.
    :::

12. ### How to run multiple statistical tests with one data table?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
    Create a table with columns for:
    - Variable or question
    - Group 1 result
    - Group 2 result
    - P-value  
    Use footnotes to explain test types.
    :::

13. ### How to choose the right statistical test for mixed yes/no results and average scores in small QI cycles?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
    - Yes/no or categories: Chi-square or McNemar’s
    - Averages: T-test (independent or paired)
    Use descriptive stats first.
    :::

14. ### For small data sets, how to draw useful conclusions without power analysis?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
    Focus on **trends or patterns**, percent change, or confidence intervals. Describe improvements qualitatively and use graphs.
    :::

15. ### Dealing with missing survey answers or chart audit gaps?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
    Note the **percent missing** (surveys). Add a “Data Present (Y/N)” column for audits. Report frequency of missing data for transparency.
    :::

16. ### How to verify pre/post quiz score improvements reflect learning, not just question remembering?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
    Use a **Paired t-test** for pre/post score comparison. Change question order or use equivalent but different questions to minimize memory bias.
    :::

17. ### Does using a self-created Likert scale affect pre/post-test validity and use of paired t-test?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
    It may affect validity but you can still use a paired t-test. Report that it’s a new scale and consider pilot testing for clarity.
    :::

18. ### How to store data for analyses involving both surveys and simulation scores?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
    Use one Excel file with separate tabs for surveys and simulation scores. Keep a consistent ID to match participants.
    :::

19. ### Is it better to store Likert responses as words or numbers?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
    Either is fine—just be consistent and include a codebook or key to explain.
    :::

20. ### How to get consent to add a study at a clinical site?
    ::: {.faq-answer}
