## Definition and Purpose of Repeated Measures ANOVA

Repeated Measures ANOVA is a statistical test used to examine the
changes in a continuous dependent variable across multiple measurements
over time or under different conditions. It is an extension of One-Way
ANOVA but accounts for the correlation between repeated measures on the
same subjects.

### Key Differences Between Repeated Measures ANOVA and One-Way ANOVA

-   **One-Way ANOVA:** Evaluates the effect of a single independent
    variable on a continuous outcome.
-   **Repeated Measures ANOVA:** Evaluates the effect of a single or
    multiple within-subject factors over time, accounting for the
    correlation between repeated measurements.

## Understanding the Structure of a Repeated Measures Design

In a Repeated Measures design, each participant is measured multiple
times under different conditions or over time. The design includes: -
**Within-Subjects Factors:** Variables measured repeatedly on the same
subjects. - **Levels:** The different conditions or time points for each
within-subjects factor.

### Example Structure

-   **Within-Subjects Factor:** Time
-   **Levels:** Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3

## Sphericity Assumption

Sphericity refers to the assumption that the variances of the
differences between all combinations of related groups are equal. If
violated, it can lead to biased F-statistics and increased Type I
errors.

### Greenhouse-Geisser Correction

The Greenhouse-Geisser correction adjusts the degrees of freedom to
correct for violations of sphericity, providing a more conservative
estimate.

## Calculation of SS (Sum of Squares) and MS (Mean Squares)

### Sum of Squares

-   **Total Sum of Squares (SST):** $$
    SST = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{t} (Y_{ij} - \bar{Y})^2
    $$ where ( Y\_{ij} ) is each individual observation, and ( \bar{Y} )
    is the overall mean.

-   **Sum of Squares Within (SSW):** $$
    SSW = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{t} (Y_{ij} - \bar{Y}_{i\cdot})^2
    $$ where ( \bar{Y}\_{i\cdot} ) is the mean of all measurements for
    subject ( i ).

-   **Sum of Squares Between (SSB):** $$
    SSB = \sum_{j=1}^{t} n_j (\bar{Y}_{\cdot j} - \bar{Y})^2
    $$ where ( \bar{Y}\_{\cdot j} ) is the mean for level ( j ), and (
    n_j ) is the number of observations at level ( j ).

### Mean Squares

-   **Mean Square Within (MSW):** $$
    MSW = \frac{SSW}{(n - 1)(t - 1)}
    $$

-   **Mean Square Between (MSB):** $$
    MSB = \frac{SSB}{t - 1}
    $$

## Hypothesis Testing for Main Effects and Interaction

### Hypotheses

-   **Main Effect of Within-Subjects Factor:**
    -   Null Hypothesis (( H_0 )): No difference in the means across
        levels.
    -   Alternative Hypothesis (( H_1 )): At least one level has a
        different mean.
-   **Interaction Effect:**
    -   Null Hypothesis (( H_0 )): No interaction between
        within-subjects factors.
    -   Alternative Hypothesis (( H_1 )): An interaction exists between
        factors.

### F-Ratio Calculations

-   **Main Effect of Within-Subjects Factor:** $$
    F = \frac{MSB}{MSW}
    $$

### Interpretation

-   Compare the F-ratio to the critical value from the F-distribution.
-   If the calculated F-ratio is greater than the critical value, reject
    the null hypothesis.

## Effect Sizes and Significance

### Eta Squared (( \eta\^2 ))

Represents the proportion of the total variance explained by the
within-subjects factor.

-   **Within-Subjects Factor:** $$
    \eta^2 = \frac{SSB}{SST}
    $$

## Bonferroni Correction

A post-hoc correction used to reduce Type I errors when multiple
comparisons are made.

### Formula

$$
\alpha_{\text{corrected}} = \frac{\alpha}{m}
$$ where ( m ) is the number of comparisons.

## Checking Assumptions of Repeated Measures ANOVA

### Sphericity

-   Use Mauchly's test to check the assumption of sphericity.

### Normality

-   Use Q-Q plots to check the normality of residuals.

### Homogeneity of Variances

-   Ensure variances are approximately equal across conditions.

## Examples of Repeated Measures ANOVA in Nursing Research

### Example 1: Evaluating Blood Pressure Changes Over Time

-   **Research Question:** How does blood pressure change over a 3-week
    intervention period?
-   **Within-Subjects Factor:** Time
-   **Levels:** Baseline, Week 1, Week 3
-   **Response Variable:** Blood Pressure
